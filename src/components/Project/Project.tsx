              <h3>MRS</h3>
              <p>
                In this project, I developed a comprehensive Medical Records
                System (MRS) designed to streamline the management of medical
                record processing tasks. The application features robust
                functionality for admin users to allocate and manage jobs,
                including splitting large jobs into smaller tasks, merging
                multiple jobs, and assigning jobs to employees based on
                predefined configurations. The system supports employee logins,
                allowing staff to track their job statuses and progress through
                different levels of quality assurance.

                This application is mainly focused on Routing & Tracking the
                mining truck Locations. Used Mapbox library for creating layers
                & routes. Used highcharts for creating charts related to the
                data of trucks in mining.Working knowledge of front-end
                optimization and performance techniques. Makes design
                recommendations towards the development of new code or reuse of
                existing code. Took an active role in structuring our reusable
                components to make them easy to maintain and to ensure they are
                highly modularized.

              <p>
                HRMS application helps any organization to manage employee
                details & assets etc. Admin can create tenants & employees and
                manage their data and give only specific access to them, which
                they can moodify but new access cannot be added by them until
                and unless its approved by admin. Cooperated with the back-end
                developer in the process of building the RESTful API.I have been
                responsible for maintenance of applications with technologies
                such as HTML5/JavaScript/Bootstrap. Collaborated with the QA team to define test cases, and metrics, and resolve questions
                about test results.
